# Binary Trees

## 1. Binary Tree:

This [code](BinaryTree.py) shows how to create a Binary Tree using a Menu Driven approach.

Following are the operations I have performed on Binary Trees:

- Creation of Root node `createRoot()` followed by creation of whole tree `createTree()`. It uses **Recursive** approach to create the tree.
- Traversing the tree:
  1. Inorder -- `inorder()`
  2. Preorder -- `preorder()`
  3. Postorder -- `postorder()`
  4. Level-order -- `levelorder()`
- Counting height of the tree using `height()`.

## 2. Binary Search Tree:

This [code](BinarySearchTree.py) shows how to create a Binary Search Tree using a Menu Driven approach. I have implemented operations using both Iterative and Recurise method.

Following are the operations I have performed on Binary Search Tree:

- Add single/multiple item(s) using `insertion_iterative()` (Iterative) and `insertion_recursive()` (Recursive).

- Search for an item using `search_iterative()` (Iterative) and `search_recursive()` (Recursive).

- Deletion of a node using `delete()`:
    1. Leaf node.
    2. Node with one subtree.
    3. Node with two subtree.

- I have used `inorder()` function from the Binary Tree code mentioned above to display the Binary Search Tree.
